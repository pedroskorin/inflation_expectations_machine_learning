# inflation_expectations_machine_learning

This is the final project for the 2024/1 version of the course EAE3709: Applications of Machine Learning in Economics at PUC-Chile.

The project title is "Determinantes de las Expectativas de Inflaci√≥n: Un Enfoque de Machine Learning." We use Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and XGBoost to estimate individual inflation expectations using demographic and socioeconomic data from FED-NY.

There are two files:
report.pdf : a paper-style report containing the main fininds of the projec
main.ipynb : a commented code of the training and test of the models

The report and code comments are all in Spanish.
